#### SEADOGS PROJECT 2
For this second project, we will "tell a story" through data visualizations.

Instead of using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.

We will conduct a 10 minute presentation that lays out our theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.
